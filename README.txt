Hello, welcome to TicTacToe!
This is a two-player game. One player will be "X', and one player will be "O". Whoever you decide to go first, will use "X". The objective is to get three X's or O's in a line either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in the 3x3 game square. The board is a 3x3 square and users will be prompted to choose a number 1-9 which correlates to a spot on the board. The top left square is square 1 and left to right, like reading a book, the numbers follow in order.
